# drupalgap-robot-projects

You will need a working copy of [robot](https://github.com/zak-schlemmer/robot).

```
git clone git@github.com:zak-schlemmer/drupalgap-robot-projects.git /etc/robot/projects/drupalgap
cd /etc/robot/projects/drupalgap
./integrate.drupalgap.sh
```

You will then have the projects availble for build.
